#### How to build and run

* Windows

To build, just type
> gradlew.bat build

then
> gradlew.bat run

There you go!
Now the native library only support x64 [I would rather not say that I was lazy to download x32 dll AwA]

* Linux && MacOS

I have no computer running Linux or MacOS so ...

# Have fun!
